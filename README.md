# Book Data to Spreadsheet
This is a simple script that automatically adds data about a book to a Google Sheet spreasheet. It prompts the user to enter the ISBN of a
book, and then uses it to fetch the data using the OpenLibrary API. It formats the relevant information and adds it to a new row on the
spreadsheet using the Sheety API.

The "main" function then loops and asks for a new number. It can be exited out of by simply typing the word "quit".

This was created merely as a programming exercise, but I think it's quite useful :)

Any feedback is welcomed!
